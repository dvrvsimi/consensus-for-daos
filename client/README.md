# Consensus-for-DAOs Client

This is the front-end for **Consensus-for-DAOs**, an open-source voting platform for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). It allows members to vote on proposals through a React-based interface.

## Getting Started

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Follow the steps below to set up the client.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes. Any linting errors will also be displayed in the console.

```bash
npm test
```

Runs the test suite in watch mode.

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production and outputs to the `build` folder.\
React is bundled in production mode for optimized performance.

```bash
npm run eject
```

Removes Create React App configuration and dependencies.\
This is irreversible. You should only use this if you need full control over the projectâ€™s configuration.
